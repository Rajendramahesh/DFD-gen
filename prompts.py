    - Identify all processes (e.g., application components, APIs, services).

    - Identify all data flows (connections between entities, processes, and stores). 
    - Clearly specify trust boundaries (separating external actors and internal systems).

    Generate a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) in Mermaid syntax for the following system use case and fetch code base architecture/tree from repo :

    UseCase: {usecase}

    Requirements:
    1. Identify external entities, processes, and data stores.
    2. Show all data flows with appropriate labels.
    3. Group elements under trust boundaries (e.g., Internet, Application, External Services).
    4. After the diagram, provide a Threat Analysis (STRIDE) in a Markdown table with:
    - Element
    - STRIDE category
    - Threat description
    - Mitigation

    The output must contain:
    - A runnable Mermaid code block (```mermaid ... ```).
    - A Markdown table for the STRIDE threat analysis.
